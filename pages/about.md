## **My Background**

Since you clicked here, I guess you're interested in learning more about me. My name is Thomas, I'm 19 years old and I am currently a second-year Media, Journalism and Publishing student at Oxford Brookes University. Since a very young age I have been captivated by the world of design and its many intricacies. Having grown up in the countryside, despite its beauty, I often preferred to stay indoors, discovering I was more introverted than extroverted, making me spend more time on the computer. 

## **My Interest**

My first introduction to design was through my father, who introduced me to Adobe Photoshop CS6. Like anyone would be, I was clueless at the start, having no idea how to navigate such a complex application. Then my Dad bought me a book that changed everything, slowly guiding me through the basics of photoshop and eventually working my way up to the more advanced features within the application. 

Eventually, I managed to get a solid grasp of Photoshop and became rather fascinated with typographical design. The ability to install the fonts used within my favourite franchises was an eye-opener to me and allowed me to create designs that could resemble those of the logos I saw in movies and video games. Eventually, I began to look at the world around me a lot more, becoming intrigued as to which fonts were being used by different companies. When I couldn't figure out the font, I used a website known as dafont.com, a forum that allowed you to post pictures of text where users would try to identify the font for you. Eventually, my interest in typographical design became a regular hobby of mine, waxing and waning over time depending on how busy life was and how much time I had.

For now, design is still a simple hobby of mine. As of late, I have enjoyed redesigning album covers in my free time for certain artists whom I admire, as well as creating covers for my Spotify playlists. Whilst I have become more extroverted over time, my interest in design, and specifically, typography still remains. This lasting interest is the reasoning behind his website, which acts as a place to explore the past as well as the future of the typographical realm.
